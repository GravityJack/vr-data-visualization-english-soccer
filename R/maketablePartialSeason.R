#' Make a league table
#'
#' @param df The results dataframe
#' @param Season The Season
#' @param tier The tier
#' @param pts Points for a win. Default is 3.
#' @section Notes:
#' The table that is produced is based upon 3 points for a win (unless otherwise
#' defined), 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss.  The table is sorted based upon descending
#' GD and then descending GF as tie-breakers. Different leagues have had different
#' methods for tie-breaks over the years. This league table is a simple generic one.
#' It also does not evaluate points deducted from teams or if games were  artificially
#' awarded to one side based on games not being played.
